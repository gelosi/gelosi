- 👋 Hi, I’m Oleg
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile apps, and iOS platform. Also, I like cool tooling for devs, and love to see it's on a Mac.
- 🤖 Automation is my new joy. Currently working on the full automatic release pipeline (seeing it as a programmable factory assembling, testing, piping data, connecting dots, and delivering apps)
- 🐘 testing world buzz via @gelosi@mastodon.social
- 🐦 you can find me on twitter as (tada!) @gelosi
- ☺️ also, as a hobby, I like to translate apps to Ukrainian
- 🐍 using Python as my play-and-experimenting tool – and I find it cool!
